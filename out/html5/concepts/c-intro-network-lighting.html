They are different, however, in a couple of ways:</p><ul class="ul">
<li class="li">The lighting element in the light bulb uses energy-efficient LED technology.</li>
<li class="li">The light bulb includes wireless technology that allows the light bulb to connect to a network and be managed remotely.</li>
</ul><p class="p">Because the light bulbs can be connected to a network, you have greater flexibility in how you use them.</p><section class="section example/concept/example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Examples</h2>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">You can program your lighting network so that when you press a button upon arriving home, an entryway and a hallway light turn on.</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">When you go to bed, your remote control can turn off all lights on the network.</p></li>
<li class="li">Network lighting operates at a low level of networking power but can successfully connect at long distances because they can send information from light bulb to light bulb.</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Testing shows you should network no more than 250 light bulbs to maintain reliable performance.</p></li>
</ul>
