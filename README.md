# Cross-format Content with Lightweight DITA (LwDITA spec draft as of Nov 4, 2016)

## Contents

- Introductory topic and concepts in HDITA
- Tasks in DITA and XDITA
- References in MarkDITA
- DITAMAP

**This does not transform... experimental LwDITA authoring modes included**

## Known issues

- In HDITA files, the *title* and *h1* elements repeat the same content
- In MDITA files, we need an ID... I am using [Pandoc header identifiers](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#header-identifiers) (easier than full YAML headers)
